# Database Strategy: SQLite for Development, Prisma for Scalability

This document outlines the rationale behind using SQLite during the initial development phase of this project, and how Prisma ORM facilitates a seamless transition and scalability to more robust database systems like PostgreSQL for future commercial applications.

## 1. Why SQLite for Development?

**SQLite** is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. Its choice for the development environment is driven by several key advantages:

* **Practicality and Simplicity:** SQLite is incredibly easy to set up. Unlike server-based databases (like PostgreSQL or MySQL), SQLite databases are simply single files (`.db` files) on the disk. There's no separate server process to install, configure, start, or stop. This makes local development and testing remarkably straightforward.
* **Low Resource Consumption:** Being a file-based database, SQLite consumes minimal system resources. It doesn't require a dedicated server daemon running in the background, making it very light on CPU and RAM usage, which is ideal for individual developer machines or CI/CD pipelines.
* **Zero Configuration:** Getting started with SQLite requires virtually no configuration. You just point your application to a `.db` file, and it handles the rest. This drastically speeds up initial development and prototyping.

**In essence, SQLite offers an unparalleled developer experience for rapid iteration and local testing due to its ease of use and lightweight nature.**

## 2. The Function of Prisma ORM

**Prisma** is a next-generation ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that simplifies database access and management in Node.js and TypeScript applications. It consists of three main parts:

* **Prisma Schema:** A declarative way to define your database schema using a concise and intuitive language. This schema acts as the single source of truth for your database structure.
* **Prisma Migrate:** A powerful migration system that automatically generates SQL migration files based on changes in your Prisma schema. It allows you to evolve your database schema in a controlled and versioned manner.
* **Prisma Client:** An auto-generated, type-safe, and high-performance database client. It provides a clean and intuitive API for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data from your database, abstracting away raw SQL queries.

**Prisma's core function is to provide a modern, type-safe, and efficient way to interact with your database, bridging the gap between your application code and the underlying data layer.**

## 3. How Prisma Facilitates Scalability (from SQLite to PostgreSQL)

One of the most significant advantages of using Prisma is how it simplifies database migration and enables scalability to more complex and production-ready database systems like PostgreSQL.

* **Database Agnostic Schema:** The Prisma schema you define is largely database-agnostic. While you specify a `provider` (e.g., `sqlite` or `postgresql`), the core data models (e.g., `Property`, `PropertyImage`) are defined once. This means your application's data models remain consistent regardless of the underlying database.
* **Simplified Driver Management:** Prisma handles the specific database drivers and SQL dialects internally. Your application code interacts with the Prisma Client API, not directly with database-specific SQL. This means that when you switch databases, your application's data fetching and manipulation logic largely remains unchanged.
* **Effortless Database Switching:** Migrating from SQLite to PostgreSQL primarily involves two steps:
    1.  **Changing the `provider` in `schema.prisma`:** You simply update the `datasource db` block from `provider = "sqlite"` to `provider = "postgresql"`.
    2.  **Updating the `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`:** You provide the connection string for your PostgreSQL database (e.g., hosted on a cloud provider like Render, Railway, or locally).
    3.  **Running Prisma Migrate:** Executing `npx prisma migrate deploy` (or `dev`) will then generate and apply the necessary SQL to create your schema in the new PostgreSQL database.
* **Data Migration (Manual Step):** While Prisma handles schema migration, moving existing data from a SQLite `.db` file to a new PostgreSQL database typically requires a separate one-time data export/import process using database tools or custom scripts. However, the application code doesn't need to change to accommodate this.

**In conclusion, by using Prisma ORM, we leverage a powerful abstraction layer that decouples our application's data logic from the specific database implementation. This strategic choice allows us to enjoy the development speed and simplicity of SQLite during prototyping and development, while ensuring a smooth, controlled, and minimally disruptive transition to a robust, production-grade database like PostgreSQL as the project scales.**
