## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 18.x or higher recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### **Installation**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git)
    ```
    (Remember to replace `your_username` with your GitHub username and `your_repository_name` with your actual repository name!)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your_repository_name # e.g., cd real-estate-ai-portfolio
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use Yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Create an environment file (`.env.local`):**
    In the root of your project, create a file named `.env.local`. This is where you'll store sensitive API keys. For now, if you don't have OpenAI keys, you can leave it empty or add a placeholder.

    ```
    # .env.local
    # OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```
    *(Ensure this file is not committed to Git. Next.js's `.gitignore` usually excludes it by default.)*

### **Run the Development Server**

1.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or if you use Yarn
    # yarn dev
    ```

2.  **Access the application:**
    Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`.
